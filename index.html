    <h3>About My Birth </h3>
    <p>Birthday: March 16,2004
      <br> Born In: San Diego, CA
    <br> I was born sometime in the afternoon so my mom always says I was a lazy baby. But in reality i was born a day early so if anything, I was a proactive baby.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="Small Times" class="tabcontent">
    <h3>Before 2nd Grade</h3>
    <p>School: Creekside Elementary
      <br> Mascot: Gecko
      <br> I went to Creekside Elementary School, it was pretty lit.  
    <br> At this age I really liked Justin Beiber. I had a friend that *said* she was a vampire - I was skeptical but also lwky kinda believed it. Vampire girl disliked this other girl because vampire girl thought she was a werewolf. 
    <br> I had another friend who did child modeling - my mom occasionally talks to her mom - i think she turned out okay but I'm not sure. 
    <br> I once walked straight into a pole at the school while going home - idk what I was doing, but I certainly didnt have a phone at that time. </p>
  </div>

  <div id="Still Small" class="tabcontent">
    <h3>The Move</h3>
    <p>School: Deer Canyon Elementary
      <br> Mascot: White Tail Deer
    <br> The school somehow didn't have a mascot yet until a year after I transfered there and they had us vote. THey had like student submissions and then we voted on them. I voted for white tails and I'm pretty sure when I searched up what a white tail was, it said it was a tiger but yeah. Also lwky wanted Deer Canyon Dragons yep mhm third grade brains right there. I don't know why they weren't just like we're deers because oh idk OUR NAME.
    <br> Deer Canyon will never be as lit as Creekside but like i had fun and had fun friends. 
    <br> This was the time where I ran a lot because you could get prizes for it, and tbh all that running helped me not die in middle school and ENS.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="Middle" class="tabcontent">
    <h3>Middle School ~eh~</h3>
    <p>School: Mesa Verde Middle School
      <br> Mascot: Eagle - what kind? idk
    <br>Sixth Grade: It was fine - I had a teacher that used to teach at Deer Canyon who already knew me aka Mrs.Fice. This was also the start of me being bad at math.
    <br>Seventh Grade: Joie Nolasco will always be iconic- 511 Joie. I hated sentence diagraming but Renaissance fair will always be great. 
    <br>Eigth Grade: Jennifer Hanson - she loved all the girls - I never got in trouble. I sat at a table with all guys and partially helped carry out something that caused Hanson to say something along the lines of "That entire table - except Shannon - is not going to break until that is cleaned up." BEcause she didn't think that I had taken part in such a foul act. </p>

  <div id="High" class="tabcontent">
    <h3>High Schoool</h3>
    <p>School: Westveiw High School
      <br> Mascot: Wolverine - but rly it's just that claw thing because who would put a wolverine on their merch

    <h3>9th Grade</h3>
    <p> Freshman Year: It wasn't bad but I did take Honors English and hated it and did terrible. I dropped APES. I did amazingly well in Int 2 and terrible in Int 3. ENS was good with Pidgeon and Champoux. I somehow did not procrastinate on that bio board. Physics was confusing and my lab group carried me. Marketing Econ with Rankin was nice - she liked me and my friend. She was kind of confusing though.
    </p>
    </div>
    
  <div id="10th Grade" class="tabcontent">
    <h3>10th Grade</h3>
    <p>Sophmore Year: I'm in Honors Humanities like an idiot. Who let me take this class when Honors English was terrible. It was because I was like: I need to take this cuz I'm going to take APEL." Guess what I'm not taking APEL anymore because I don't want to actually die. World History with Jain was great. Chem 1-2 with Christopher has completely been removed from my memory. Calc AB is a struggle. AP Bio with Ingram is good and really chill - I don
    t know if I learned anything. Web Design is chill and doesn't make me want to die. Honors Hmanities makes me want to die.
